# ProctorAI+

**ProctorAI+** is a next-generation, AI-powered exam proctoring system designed with a privacy-first philosophy.  
It goes beyond simple gaze tracking by creating a holistic, multi-modal understanding of a student's test-taking environment and behavior.

The system analyzes video and audio feeds in real-time on the student's local machine (at the edge) to detect potential academic dishonesty.  
All sensitive video/audio data remains on the user's device, ensuring privacy. Only anonymized, encrypted alerts are sent to the administrator's dashboard.

This repository contains the full-stack web application for managing, taking, and reviewing proctored exams.

## ‚ú® Core Features

### ü§ñ AI Proctoring Agent (Python Client)
- **Dual Attention Model:** Correlates head pose (MediaPipe) with voice activity (VAD) to reduce false positives from innocent glances.  
- **Ambient Environment Detection:** Uses YOLOv8 to detect unauthorized objects like mobile phones, open books, or additional people in the room.  
- **Micro Gesture Analysis:** Employs MediaPipe Holistic to track hand-to-face gestures or movements suggesting the use of a hidden earpiece or device.  
- **Cognitive Load Meter:** Estimates student stress and confusion by analyzing biometric proxies like blink rate (EAR) and facial expressions.  
- **Adaptive Fairness Mode:** Calibrates AI sensitivity at startup based on ambient lighting and webcam quality to ensure fairness.

### üíª Web Portal (React Frontend)
- **Dual Authentication:** Secure login and registration for two distinct user types: *Admin* (Exam Creator) and *Student* (Exam Taker).  
- **Admin Dashboard:** Admins can create new exams, view all exams, and assign specific exams to registered students.  
- **Student Dashboard:** Students see a clean list of only the exams they have been assigned.  
- **Web-Based Proctoring:** Automatically detects tab-switching and loss of browser focus, logging these events to the backend.

### üöÄ Backend & Reporting (Flask API)
- **Secure REST API:** Endpoints for user auth, exam creation/assignment, and data logging.  
- **Consolidated Event Logging:** A single API endpoint (`/log_data`) receives alerts from both the AI Agent and frontend.  
- **Admin Session Review:** Admins can view all completed proctoring sessions for any given exam.  
- **PDF Report Generation:** Download tamper-proof PDF reports detailing all flagged events and the final integrity score.
